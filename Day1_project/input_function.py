# A program that calculates and outputs the number of characters in any name. The automated tests will try out lots of different names as the input. Your code should work for any name.

# How input works
name1 = input()
name2 = input()
name3 = input()

# This is a different line of code
num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
print(num1 * num2)

# This is a different line of code
name1 = input("What is your name? ")
print(name1) #This line will print the text and line 1 of the input into the output.
name2 = input()
print(name2) #This line will only print the name on line 2 of the input pane.

# This is a different line of code
# Provide any name in the input prompt.
# That value can be accessed using the input() function.
# Don't put anything inside the input() function before running!
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
